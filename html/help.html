  <h1>Help</h1>
  <p>You are the captain of the new spaceship <i>Sonic</i>, the pride of the Earth starfleet. Your mission is to rid the Solar System of Earth's enemies, the mischievous Glornox. Your ship is equipped with ammo to destroy Glornox vessels and shields to fend off enemy attacks. But beware: your resources are limited. You must find or earn more during the hunt.</p>
  
  <p>If you succeed in destroying the invaders, you will return to Earth a hero. But if your last shield fails, your ship will implode and the Glornox will pester Earth endlessly. Good luck!</p>
  
  <h2>The Space Grid</h2>
  <p>Your computer shows the space around your ship as a simple grid of tiles. The computer labels the tiles with a row and column number, starting with row one, column one in the top left corner of the grid. To aim a shot at a tile in the grid, use the arrow keys or point at it with the mouse.</p>
  
  <p class="center"><img src="html/images/grid.png" /></p>
    
  <p>A tile might contain an enemy ship, a reward, a hazard, or nothing at all. At the start of the mission, the content of each tile is hidden from you. You must shoot a tile in the grid to reveal the object it hides. To fire a shot, press the Spacebar or click it with your mouse. You can only shoot a tile once.</p>
  
  <p>These are the objects you may encounter:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><img src="images/png/ship.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Enemy ship." /> Destroy all of these to win the game.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/ammo.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Ammo box." /> Adds one or more shots to your ship's reserves.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/shield.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Shield charger." /> Recharges one or more of your ship's shields.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/hint.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Sensor hint." /> Detects the exact location of an enemy ship.</li>    
    <li><img src="images/png/leech.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Space leech." /> Steals one or more of your ammo boxes.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/warp.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Warp trigger." /> Brings one or more enemy reinforcements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Skill Challenges</h2>
  <p>When you run out of ammo, you will face a series of challenges from local space merchants and the Glornox. A challenger first names the reward you will win or hazard you will avoid if you beat his game. The challenger next tells you how to play the game. You then try to beat the challenge to earn ammo, recharge shields, avoid enemy fire, or stop enemy reinforcements. If you lose the challenege, enemy fire might destroy your shields or new Glornox ships might appear for you to destroy.</p>
    
  <p>You will continue to face new challenges until you earn more ammo to continue your hunt or run out of shields. These some of the challenges you may encounter:</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li><b>Match it.</b> Use the arrow keys to repeat the items in the same order you saw or heard them.</li>
    <li><b>Order it.</b> Use the arrow keys to repeat the items you see and hear from smallest to largest, east to west, least to most, softest to loudest, or in whatever order the challenger names.</li>
    <li><b>Detect it.</b> Name the item as soon as you can as gets easier to hear and see.</li>
  </ul>
