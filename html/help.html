  <h1>Help</h1>
  <p>You are the captain of the new spaceship <i>Sonic</i>, the pride of the Earth starfleet. Your mission is to rid the Solar System of Earth's enemies, the mischievous Glornox. Your ship is equipped with ammo to destroy Glornox vessels and shields to fend off enemy attacks. But beware: your resources are limited. You must find or earn more during the hunt.</p>
  
  <p>If you succeed in destroying the invaders, you will return to Earth a hero. But if your last shield fails, your ship will implode and the Glornox will pester Earth endlessly. Good luck!</p>
  
  <h2>The Space Grid</h2>
  <p>Your computer shows the space around your ship as a simple grid of tiles. The computer labels the tiles with a row and column number, starting with 1,1 in the top left corner of the grid.</p> 
    
  <p>A tile might contain an enemy ship, a reward, a hazard, or nothing at all. At the start of the mission, the content of each tile is hidden from you. You must shoot at a tile in the grid to reveal the object it hides. These are the objects you may encounter:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><img src="images/png/ship.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Enemy ship." /> Destroy all of these to win the game.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/ammo.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Ammo box." /> Adds one or more shots to your ship's reserves.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/shield.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Shield charger." /> Recharges one or more of your ship's shields.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/hint.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Sensor hint." /> Detects the exact location of an enemy ship.</li>    
    <li><img src="images/png/leech.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Space leech." /> Steals one or more of your ammo boxes.</li>
    <li><img src="images/png/warp.png" style="height: 64px;" alt="Warp trigger." /> Brings one or more enemy reinforcements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>When you run out of ammo, you will have to face a series of challenges.</p>
